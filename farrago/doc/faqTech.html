<h1>Farrago Developer FAQ</h1>

<h2>How do I get a Java stack trace?</h2> 

Some front-end tools allow you to see Java stack traces directly.  For
example, in sqlline, if you issue the <code>!set verbose on</code>
command, a stack trace is reported with every subsequent error.

<p>

For other cases, you can often make use of the fact that all
exceptions propagated through the Farrago JDBC driver are traced.  In
file <code>dev/farrago/trace/FarragoTrace.properties</code>, set
<code>net.sf.farrago.jdbc.level=FINER</code>, then do whatever causes
the exception and look at the tail of file 
<code>dev/farrago/trace/FarragoTrace.log</code>.

<h2>How do I get a Fennel C++ stack trace?  How do I debug Fennel?</h2> 

At the moment, there's no nice automated stack trace like in Java
(besides a standard core dump).  However, it is possible to use gdb to
debug Fennel.  Before starting the Java virtual machine, set
environment variable <code>FENNEL_JNI_DEBUG=1</code> in the shell from
which you are going to run Java.  When the Fennel JNI layer is loaded,
you should see a message like "Waiting for debugger; pid=18454".
Start gdb and tell it to attach to the process with the given pid.
The process should be sleeping in method <code>JNI_OnLoad</code>; set
whatever breakpoints you want and then issue the gdb continue command
(see below).  Unfortunately, gdb receives many spurious signals when
attached to the Java Virtual Machine (at least on Linux, even
SIGSEGV!)  The only choices are to tell gdb to ignore them (e.g. with
the command <code>handle SIGSEGV ignore</code>), or to manually
continue past them each time (like if you want to track down a
<b>real</b> segfault).

<p>On some systems (e.g., Fedora Core 2, but it probably depends on
the version of gdb), the gdb continue command will not cause the call
to <code>sleep()</code> to end prematurely.  In this case, set
<code>FENNEL_JNI_DEBUG=2</code> and use the gdb command <code>signal
SIGHUP</code> or <code>signal 1</code> to end the call to
<code>pause()</code> in <code>JNI_OnLoad</code>.

<h2>How do I deal with bad Java code generated by the optimizer?</h2> 

The first thing to do when you an encounter an internal error
resulting from such a bug is to make sure you can see the code in
question.  In file <code>FarragoTrace.properties</code>, set
<code>net.sf.farrago.dynamic.level=FINE</code> before executing the
SQL statement.  This will guarantee that the generated .java file will
be preserved under directory
dev/farrago/classes/net/sf/farrago/dynamic/stmtXYZ (where XYZ is a
random unique suffix which you may be able to see in the error
message).  Now, use the compilation error together with the generated
source code to find the problem (at this point, someone still has to
debug the code generator to track down the origin of the problem and
fix it).  When you're done, turn off the trace (since the generated
code clutters up disk space).

<p>

If the generated Java code runs but does the wrong thing, you may have
to debug it if you can't find the problem by inspection.  Set a
breakpoint in the finally clause of method
<code>net.sf.farrago.db.FarragoDatabase.prepareStmt</code> and execute
the SQL statement.  Once this breakpoint is reached, the dynamically
compiled class should already be loaded.  Now, find the place in your
debugger where you can browse loaded classes (assuming there is one)
and navigate to package <code>net.sf.farrago.dynamic</code>.  If
there's only one class listed under there, that's it.  Otherwise, you
can use the field <code>packageName</code> from the local variable
<code>stmt</code> in the <code>prepareStmt()</code> method to find
your class in the haystack.  Now, set breakpoints in the generated
class and off you go.

<h2>Why do my trace setting changes sometimes take effect immediately,
but other times they're ignored until the next virtual machine
invocation?</h2>

The trace system has a thread which polls file
<code>FarragoTrace.properties</code> every second for changes.  When
changes are detected, the file is reloaded and the new settings are traced
to <code>FarragoTrace.log</code>.  This can be very useful in
the middle of a debugging session.

<p>

However, some subsystems (Fennel in particular) cache trace settings
for performance.  Cached trace settings are typically associated with
an object lifetime.  For example, when a TupleStream graph is first
prepared, extra trace streams are instrumented into the graph if the
corresponding trace setting is set.  These continue to trace for the
lifetime of the graph.  Conversely, if the graph was prepared when
trace was off, no extra streams are created, and the graph's execution
will never be traced even if the trace settings change in the middle.
This is intentional, but when combined with object caching, it can
make debugging mysterious.  If you want to be sure of getting
something traced, start a new VM after changing trace settings.

<h2>Why do some breakpoints get skipped entirely, even though they
must have been hit in order for a statement to execute?</h2>

Farrago employs a fairly advanced cache strategy for objects used in
the implementation of SQL statements.  This means that after the first
preparation request, subsequent preparation requests will be able to
use the cached implementation, skipping most of preparation (and your
breakpoints) entirely.  As usual, this is good for performance but
makes debugging more difficult.  You can minimize implementation
caching by executing the SQL statement <code>alter system set
"codeCacheMaxBytes"=0</code>.  When done, use <code>alter system set
"codeCacheMaxBytes"=-1</code> to remove the limit (otherwise normal
operation will be much slower).

<h2>JSwat is complaining about UnknownHostException or Socket transport error, What do I do?</h2>

To solve the UnknownHostException, add the hostname of your computer to /etc/hosts. E.g<br>
<blockquote><code>
127.0.0.1	localhost<br>
192.168.0.2	myHostName
</code></blockquote>

Run (as root) <code>service network restart</code> and try running jswat again. For non redhat users the <code>service</code> command might not be available.
<p>
If you get a <code>Socket transport failed to init</code> error when running jswat, make sure that the hostname you specified in /etc/hosts maps to the right ip address.
Use <code>ifconfig</code> to get your ip address.

<hr>
<h2>All the Farrago tests pass except the FarragoServerTest, what may be wrong?</h2> 

Check the ip address assigned to your hostname is correct in the etc/hosts.

Use <code>ifconfig</code> to get your ip address.
