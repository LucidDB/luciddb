<h1>Farrago SQL/MED Support</h1>

This document describes current plans for supporting SQL/MED
(Management of External Data), which is the post-SQL99 standard for
providing uniform relational access to foreign data (both relational
and non-relational) in other servers.

<h2>Overview</h2>

SQL/MED defines several very independent interfaces:

<ul>

<li>An SQL DDL interface for defining access to foreign data.

<li>An underlying programming-language-neutral service provider
interface to be implemented by foreign data wrappers (drivers for
various kinds of data).  This interface is wide, complex, and
non-trivial to implement.  For example, in order to support metadata
import, an implementation must support SQL queries against the
standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA (probably not something the developer of a
flat-file driver wants to deal with).

<li>Datalink interfaces (not covered in this document).

</ul>

The current plan is to support the standard DDL interface but not (or
at least not initially) the standard foreign data wrapper service
provider interface.  Instead, Farrago defines a somewhat simpler
non-standard service provider interface together with some prepackaged
implementations:

<ul>

<li>FennelRowStore: for access to data stored by Fennel in
transactional row format.  This is not really foreign data, but is
represented as such for architectural uniformity.  A normal CREATE
TABLE statement uses this implicitly.  Eventually the CREATE TABLE
statement will be extended to allow creation of other types of table
storage (e.g. FennelColumnStore for column-store format).

<li>JDBC:  for access to data stored in foreign SQL databases.

<li>MDR:  for access to metadata stored in an MDR repository
(including Farrago's own system catalog).

</ul>

Eventually, if standard SQL/MED foreign data wrapper drivers become
popular, Farrago will either provide a bridge for them as another
implementation of its non-standard interface, or will make its own
non-standard interface obsolete.  The standard DDL will remain
unchanged in any event.

<h2>Foreign Data Wrapper Definition</h2>

The standard SQL/MED DDL statement to install a driver is CREATE
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER foreign-data-wrapper-name
[ LIBRARY 'libraryName' ]
LANGUAGE language-name
[ OPTIONS ( opt-name1 'opt-value1' [, opt-name2 'opt-value2' ... ] ) ]
</code></pre>

Initially, Farrago requires the LANGUAGE to be JAVA.  The LIBRARY
name can specify either a path to a JAR or 'class X.Y.Z' where X.Y.Z
is the fully qualified name of a class already available in the
server's classpath.  Here's an example for a foreign data wrapper
capable of fetching XML files via TCP/IP:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER xml_tcpip
LIBRARY '/home/jvs/wrappers/FarragoXmlSourceReader.jar'
LANGUAGE JAVA
OPTIONS ( protocol 'TCP/IP' )
</code></pre>

According to the standard, foreign data wrappers are catalog objects.
In Farrago, they are implicitly created under the SYS_BOOT catalog
(and so must have top-level unique names).

<h2>Foreign Server Definition</h2>

Once a foreign data wrapper has been installed, it can be bound to data
provided by a particular server with the CREATE SERVER statement:

<pre><code>
CREATE SERVER foreign-server-name
[ TYPE 'server-type' ]
[ VERSION 'server-version' ]
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER foreign-data-wrapper-name
[ OPTIONS ( ... ) ]
</code></pre>

Example using the previously defined wrapper:

<pre><code>
CREATE SERVER movie_catalog
TYPE 'ANY'
VERSION '1.1'
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER xml_tcpip
OPTIONS ( url 'http://www.movie-fun-facts.org' )
</code></pre>

Any type of web server would be allowed, but it would have to support
HTTP version 1.1 (and the wrapper would expect HTTP features to work
accordingly).  As with foreign data wrappers, foreign servers are
created under the SYS_BOOT catalog, and their names must not conflict
with any other server (or catalog) in the system.

<p>

According to the SQL/MED standard, defining a foreign server does not
make its data accessible (the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE or IMPORT FOREIGN
SCHEMA statements described later are required first).  However,
Farrago introduces a non-standard mechanism for direct access.  Each
foreign server defined implies a corresponding top-level virtual
catalog.  These catalogs are virtual in the sense that no local
metadata is stored for them (and no INFORMATION_SCHEMA is defined).
Instead, metadata is acquired on-the-fly during query processing.  For
example, after the above CREATE SERVER example, the following query
might be legal:

<pre><code>
SELECT DISTINCT r.name
FROM movie_catalog.review_facts.reviewers r,
     movie_catalog.movie_facts.actors a
WHERE r.name=a.name
</code></pre>

This queries the names of all actors who have the same names as movie
reviewers.  The FarragoXmlSourceReader wrapper implementation might map
each subdirectory under the root URL to a schema, and xml files in those
subdirectories to tables.  However, a metadata query like

<pre><code>
SELECT * 
FROM movie_catalog.information_schema.table
</code></pre>

would fail unless the FarragoXmlSourceReader implementation happened
to support the INFORMATION_SCHEMA (unlikely in this case, but more
likely for a JDBC foreign data wrapper).

<p>

Virtual catalogs are read-only (it is not possible to create new
schemas, tables, or other objects under them).

<h2>Foreign Table Definition</h2>

In order for metadata about a foreign table to be stored in the
LOCALDB catalog, a CREATE FOREIGN TABLE statement is required:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE table-name
SERVER foreign-server-name
[ ( basic-column-definition1 [, basic-column-definition2 ... ] ) ]
[ OPTIONS ( ... ) ]

</code></pre>

A basic-column-definition consists of a name, a datatype, and (optionally)
a column-level OPTIONS clause.

<p>

For example:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE movie_schema.reviewers
SERVER movie_catalog
OPTIONS ( directory 'review_facts', file 'reviewers.xml' )
</code></pre>

Here, the foreign XML file previously referenced implicitly (via SQL
identifiers in the virtual catalog) is now referenced explicitly (via
wrapper-specific options).  The local schema MOVIE_SCHEMA must already
exist under the LOCALDB catalog.  Since column definitions were
omitted, the wrapper must be capable of deriving these automatically
from the XML file contents.  Now, we can issue a query like

<pre><code>
SELECT * 
FROM movie_schema.reviewers
</code></pre>

or a metadata query like

<pre><code>
SELECT column_name
FROM localhost.information_schema
WHERE table_schema = 'MOVIE_SCHEMA' 
AND table_name = 'REVIEWERS'
</code></pre>

<h2>Foreign Schema Import</h2>

In order to import metadata for a large number of tables at once, SQL/MED
provides the IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement:

<pre><code>
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA foreign-schema-name
[ LIMIT TO ( table1 [, table2 ... ] ) | EXCEPT ( table3 [, table4 ... ] ) ]
FROM SERVER foreign-server-name
INTO local-schema-name
</code></pre>

For the running example:

<pre><code>
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA movie_facts
FROM SERVER movie_catalog
INTO localhost.movie_schema
</code></pre>

Note that as with CREATE FOREIGN TABLE, local schema MOVIE_SCHEMA must
already exist before the IMPORT statement is executed.

<h2>Additional DDL</h2>

SQL/MED defines statements such as DROP/ALTER for foreign data
wrappers, servers, and tables.  It also defines additional DDL for
controlling mapping of users and routines.  For the details, consult
the standard.

<h2>Java Interfaces</h2>

The interfaces which must be implemented in order to write a new
foreign data wrapper are defined in 
<a 
href="../api/net/sf/farrago/namespace/package-summary.html#package_description">
package net.sf.farrago.namespace</a>.  The FarragoNamedColumnSet
interface is the most challenging--it's really just an import of
Saffron's table interface, meaning the implementor must understand
some of Saffron optimization, code generation, etc.  Over time a
package of abstract bases will be built up which will ease the
construction of wrappers for simple-minded data.

<h2>Repository Model</h2>

Since CWM does not cover any SQL/MED metadata, the repository model
for foreign data will be in the Farrago extension model (FEM).  Each
foreign CwmTable will have an association with a corresponding foreign
server, together with options specified when it was created.  Catalog
initialization will also create a representation for the local server,
to which CwmTables stored locally by Fennel will be attached.  Catalog
initialization will also create virtual catalogs for the local MDR
repository metadata (using FarragoMdrForeignDataWrapper).  Below is a
UML structure diagram for the SQL/MED model:

The two associations (WrapperAccessesServer and ServerStoresTable) also
imply dependencies for DROP RESTRICT/CASCADE.
