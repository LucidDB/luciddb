Farrago is an attempt to build an enterprise-class open-source RDBMS
with a modern architecture.  Why does the world need another
open-source RDBMS when there are so many already?  Please see the <a
href="faq.html">Project FAQ</a>.  A major goal is to do as little work
as possible.  Sometimes being lazy is good, and in this case many of
the required components are already available as open-source, and just
waiting to be put together.  For the parts that need custom coding,
some of the ideas from <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda">model-driven
architecture</a> can save a lot of gruntwork.  Currently, just a
skeleton of the full system exists.  The <a
href="roadmap.html">project roadmap</a> defines how to get to a fully
functional system.

<p>

The project is hosted at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/farrago">SourceForge</a>.

The source code is hosted in
<a href="http://apoptosis.dyndns.org:8080/open/">John Sichi's perforce
server</a>. A big thanks to 
<a href="http://www.perforce.com">Perforce</a> for letting us use p4d
<a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/opensource-faq.html">gratis</a>.

<h2>Status</h2>

The system is beginning to show signs of life.  Check the
<a href="status.html">current status page</a> for details.
Here's a  <a href="screenshotIsqlMdr.jpg">screenshot</a> of a
metadata query using the iSQL-Viewer tool.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

Some good starting points are the 
<a href="architecture.html">architecture overview</a> and the 
<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.  Also available are 
<a href="api/index.html">
Javadoc for all Java components</a> and 
<a href="http://fennel.sourceforge.net/doxygen/html/annotated.html">Doxygen
for C++ components</a>.

<p>

There are even some <a href="design/index.html">design docs</a>
available.  Also, some of the package descriptions in the Javadoc
contain design details.  And the <a href="faqTech.html">Developer
FAQ</a> is starting to grow.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

No matter what background you're coming from, Farrago Wants You!

<ul>

<li>
Do you like bits, bytes, bus errors, and memory barriers?  There's
some code waiting for you somewhere in Fennel (if you're a
hardcore kernel hacker, aren't you tired of reinventing the linked
list yet?).

<li>
Application developer?  Creating a table isn't much different from
creating a new customer account, and the design patterns employed in
Farrago and Fennel should make you feel right at home.  Or if you're
into generic Java server technology, work on integrating Farrago into
your favorite app server.

<li>
Client side?  Work on JDBC or ODBC drivers, or make Farrago show up in
one of the many management platforms out there.

<li>
Script-junkie?  You name it, we probably need it.

<li>
Do the prison cell aesthetics of this website offend you?  That's
intentional.  Help do something about it!

<li>
